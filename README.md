Lab materials for CP201B: Planning Methods Gateway II, Part 1, UC Berkeley - Spring 2023

Professor: Daniel A. Rodriguez

GSI: Meiqing Li

## Installation Instructions

Anaconda is a useful package management software that allows you to run Python and Jupyter notebooks very easily. Installing Anaconda is the easiest way to make sure you have all the necessary software to run the materials for this workshop. Complete the following steps:

1. [Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.9 distribution)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Click "Download" and then click 64-bit "Graphical Installer" for your current operating system.

2. Download the [Lab materials](https://github.com/meiqingli/CP201B-Spr23):

* Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
* Click "Download Zip".
* Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).

3. Optional: if you're familiar with `git`, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering `git clone https://github.com/meiqingli/CP201B-Spr23.git`.

## Run the code

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the code:

1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application. You should see the green snake logo appear on your screen. Note that this can take a few minutes to load up the first time. 

2. Click the "Launch" button under "Jupyter Notebooks" and navigate through your file system to the `CP201B-Spr23` folder you downloaded above.

3. In the folder, open the `00_lab_setup.ipynb` to begin.

4. Press Shift + Enter (or Ctrl + Enter) to run a cell.

## Is Python not working on your laptop? 

If you do not have Anaconda installed and the materials loaded on your workshop by the time it starts, we *strongly* recommend using the UC Berkeley Datahub to run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by clicking this button: 

[![Datahub](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-datahub-blue)](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmeiqingli%2FCP201B-Spr23&urlpath=tree%2FCP201B-Spr23%2F&branch=main)

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and allows you to run the materials in a Jupyter notebook that is stored on UC Berkeley's servers. No installation is necessary from your end - you only need an internet browser and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go straight to [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and you click on the `CP201B-Spr23` folder.

**Troubleshoot**
If you run into trouble launching `CP201B-Spr23` folder in Datahub, go through the following steps: 

1. Sign into [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu). 
2. Show the list of files/folders in your directory using the `ls` command.
3. Remove the old `CP201B-Spr23` folder with `rm -rf [FOLDER_NAME]`(i.e., `rm -rf CP201B-Spr23`).
4. Launch by clickig the blue button again.
