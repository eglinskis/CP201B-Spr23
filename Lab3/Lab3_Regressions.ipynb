If you have a question that may result in a one-on-one breakout room (think: detailed inquiry, conceptual question, or help debugging), please ask it in the chat!\n",
    "* We recognize learning Python via Zoom comes with its challenges and that there are many modes of learning. Please go with what works best for you. That might be printing out the Jupyter notebook, duplicating it such that you can refer to the original, working directly in it. Up to you! There isn't a single right way.\n",
    "* This lab requires that you download the following file and place it in the same directory as this Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "    * `clean_property_data.csv`\n",
    "* This data includes properties that were sold through a real estate site (like Zillow) between 2001 and 2006 in Bogota. There are apartments and houses, characteristics of the structure like area and bathrooms, and characteristics of the neighborhood like density and a proxy for neighborhood income which is called SES."

    "As discussed in lecture, planners can use regressions in a multitude of ways, from diagnosing a problem or bringing it to light, to determining at what level to intervene, to assessing the impact of an intervention. The kind of regression you will run depends on what phenomenon you want to understand (your dependent variable) and what factor(s) you hypothesize may be associated with it (your independent variables; explanatory or control variables)."
